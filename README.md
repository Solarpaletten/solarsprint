# Solar Sprint

Multi-tenant task management system with context preservation.

## What is Solar Sprint

Solar Sprint is a web application for managing "Task Capsules" — context-preserving tasks designed for professionals who need to return to complex work after days or weeks without losing context.

**Core concept:** Task Capsule replaces memory. User never "remembers" — the system preserves everything.

## Role of AI Agents

Solar Sprint is developed using a multi-agent pipeline:

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Junior** | Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B | Code executor — writes code by specs |
| **Alama** | LLaMA 3 8B | Reasoning engine — analyzes repo, generates GitKeeper |
| **Claude** | Claude | Senior engineer — architecture, code review |
| **Dashka** | — | Supervisor — pipeline coordination |

### GitKeeper

The `docs/gitkeeper.md` file is the single source of truth for this project. It is generated by Alama based on actual codebase analysis and contains:

- Architecture decisions (FREEZE)
- Sprint scope
- API contracts
- Acceptance criteria
- Engineering checklist

## Version

**Current:** MVP v0.1 (Bootstrap)
