**Project Overview**
The solar-sprint project is a Next.js application that utilizes Prisma as its ORM and TypeScript for type checking. The project has a complex directory structure, indicating a large-scale application with multiple features.

The architecture pattern appears to be a combination of Micro Frontends (MFE) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR). The presence of separate `app/` directories and the use of Prisma suggest that the application is divided into smaller, independent components. Next.js's SSR capabilities enable client-side rendering for improved performance.

**Directory Structure Analysis**
The directory structure is complex, with multiple levels of nesting. This suggests a large-scale application with many features and dependencies. The presence of `.next/` directories indicates that Next.js is being used to generate static sites and server-side rendered pages.

* `app/`: Contains the main application code.
* `node_modules/`: Houses dependen...
